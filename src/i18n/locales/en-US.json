    "softwareDept": "Software Development Division",
    "softwareDesc": "We focus on developing process automation systems to help enterprises transform repetitive, time-consuming, and error-prone workflows into stable and traceable digital systems, reducing manual operation costs and improving overall operational efficiency. In many organizations, workflows often rely on manual operations and individual experience. As the scale grows, problems also expand. We gain a deep understanding of actual workflows, reorganize the data flow and decision points at each stage, and provide customized automation systems that meet practical needs. In system design, we emphasize scalability and long-term maintainability, ensuring systems can adjust as the organization grows without frequent reconstruction. At the same time, we emphasize process transparency, allowing managers to grasp status in real-time, reduce communication costs, and improve overall decision-making efficiency.",
